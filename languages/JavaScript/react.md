# React Style Guide

## Use semantic elements in React

In HTML5 there are many elements that have semantic meaning like `<section>` and `<footer>`. There are also common elements that will appear throughout the codebase like `<a>` and `<button>` these should be preferred over `<div>` wherever possible because they carry semantic meaning and it's inherently better for accessibility.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Why: **Accessibility**

A webpage is often created to be visual but the markup used to create the page is even more important. Using elements that aren't intended to be clickable means you lose a lot of the benefits of semantic HTML. To correct these, you have to ensure the element has aria attributes, a tab index, focus and hover states etc. Using the correct semantic elements also has the benefit of making it easier for accessibility and can be consumed by screen readers.

### ‚ùì When: **Wherever there exists a more specific element**

A common case for using non-semantic elements is for styling purposes. This is unnecessary, each browser applies a its own style to `<button>` and `<a>` elements. You should override these styles rather than using a more generic element.

### ‚ùå Don't: **Add click handlers to non-clickable elements**

Avoid adding click handlers to elements that are not clickable by nature

```jsx
<div onClick={handleEvent} />
<img onClick={handleEvent} />
```

If an image should be clickable, wrap it in a clickable element like so:

```jsx
<button onClick={handleEvent}>
  <img />
</button>
```

### ‚úÖ Do: **Use `<a>` or an appropriate link component, for navigation.**

`<a>` should be preferred for navigation, an added benefit of suing the semantically correct elements is that users can open them in a new tab easily. It also conforms to the design patterns of the web.

```jsx
<a href="/car-insurance/">Car Insurance</a>
<Link to="car-insurance">Car Insurance</Link>
```

Use `<button>` elements for actions that don't perform a navigation and/or rely on state.

```jsx
<button onClick={showDialog} />
<button onClick={dismissBanner} />
```

### ü§ñ ESLint Rule: **eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y**

Plugin available: [eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y](https://www.npmjs.com/package/eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y) that covers most of these rules.

## Avoid hard-coding colours in React

Throughout the code, avoid hard-coding in colours that can be found in `website-next/src/theme.js`. Instead import in and use helper functions such as `primaryColor, disabledColor` to use a specific colour. This excludes any custom colours that design may include.

### ‚ÑπÔ∏è Why: **Ease of Future Colour Changes and Decrease Human Error**

In the event, the colour palette changes or design wants to make a change to a colour, it will make for a clean change in only the theme file and avoid an extensive refactor to trace all usages of that particular colour(s). It will also help to decrease human error of typing in a wrong hex colour.

### ‚ùì When: **Any changes to webpages that include new or updated colours**

These new or updated colours are typically found in Figma files and / or the acceptance criteria for a ticket.

### ‚ùå Don't: **Hard-code colours**

Avoid hard-coding colours that are found in the `website-next/src/theme.js` file.

```jsx
<button css={{backgroundColor: '#371987'}}>Click Me</button>
```

### ‚úÖ Do: **Use the helper functions available in the `website-next/src/theme.js` file**

For example,

```jsx
import { primaryColor } from '@zego/theme.js'

<button css={{backgroundColor: primaryColor(11)}}>Click Me</button>
```
