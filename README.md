# Zego Coding Style Guide

This style guide serves to present a set of good and bad conventions with the objective of improving overall code readability and architecture.
At Zego we use Python for backend development and JavaScript for frontend development. This guide should ultimately define what we consider the best way to write the cleanest code for either of the languages and the frameworks used within backend and frontend.
